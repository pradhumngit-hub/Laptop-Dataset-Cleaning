# Laptop Dataset Cleaning (SQL)

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a laptop dataset using SQL. The goal is to handle missing values, remove outliers, and engineer new features to make the data analysis-ready.

## Problem
The dataset contained missing prices, inconsistencies, and outliers, affecting the accuracy of analytics.

## Solution
- Checked and handled missing values using SQL techniques.
- Identified outliers with statistical methods.
- Added new columns for better data insights (e.g., screen size, PPI).
- Created visualizations using histograms and aggregations.

## Key Features
✔ Missing value handling  
✔ Outlier detection and removal  
✔ Feature engineering for deeper insights

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL Server  
- Data visualization tools (Google Sheets, etc.)

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset into SQL Server.
2. Run queries to clean and structure data.
3. Export cleaned data for reporting.
